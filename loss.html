<h2>1. LEFT TO ROT IN THE FIELDS</h2>
Picture a sunny, wholesome country scene. Like something out of an advert for organic apple juice – long rows of trees heavy with fruit. Sunlight glinting through the leaves.

Now pan down a bit to see what the ground looks like beneath those trees. If this dreamy orchard is anything like the ones that supply supermarkets, the soil isn’t visible. It’s buried under a carpet of discarded fruit.

Pickers are trained to reject fruit for a variety of superficial reasons. The colour might be uneven, or there might be a nose-shaped knob near the stem.

None of these flaws has any effect on flavour. But growers know about supermarkets’ strict cosmetic standards. So it isn’t worth their time to pack and ship anything that wouldn’t win a fruity beauty pageant.

There is little hard data on how much food wastage there is from the fields. But it doesn’t take many visits to commercial farms to see how widespread the problem is.

One potato farmer estimates that he leaves 25% of his harvest in the fields due to imperfections. What a way to treat our staple starch!

<h2>2. DROPS IN DEMAND</h2>
Even if you don’t happen to have a degree in economics, you’ve probably heard of the concept of supply and demand. Simply put, the price of a product varies over time depending on how much people want it.

This variability looks clean-cut on a graph. Real life however, tells a different story. Supply and demand is about as predictable as the weather on a spring day in London. Market fluctuations are especially dangerous for farmers.

If lots of people want a given fruit or vegetable during the planting season, farmers are likely to plant a lot of it. What if that demand dries up by the time harvest rolls around?

It will leave farmers with a bumper crop that won’t sell. When supermarkets and distributors don’t buy it, farmers have little choice other than to send it to landfill.

This might be the most tragic of all causes of food waste – surplus produce that has nothing wrong with it. Not even the superficial flaws that the supermarkets reject.

That flawless fruit and veg would look lovely on the plates of the 8 million food-insecure people in the UK. Sadly the only mouth it feeds is the one on a waste compactor.

<h2>3. DAMAGED DURING SHIPPING</h2>
Despite advancements in refrigerated lorries and flash-freezing, transporting food is tricky. By the time our food reaches us from its far-flung origins, all manner of things could have gone wrong.

Someone could set the temperature settings on their high-tech lorry incorrectly. This would cause the food to melt, rot or develop freezer burn.

On a particularly bumpy road, fruits can knock into each other and develop bruises. And you know the supermarkets aren’t having any of that.

Even the weather — that fickle mistress — can have a dramatic effect on the success of a shipment. If it ends up being hotter than expected on shipping day, produce can wilt to nothing by the time it reaches its destination.

Of course, this problem would be alleviated if we chose locally produced food and didn’t rely on imported produce. Until then, global demands ask farmers to ship their produce far from home and suffer the potential consequences.

<h2>4. GRADED OUT AT THE PACKHOUSE</h2>
Produce may survive its perilous journey from the farm. But there’s no guarantee that it won’t be wasted when it reaches its next destination. Next in line is the packhouse, a processing facility before distribution.

The packhouse functions as a kind of produce purgatory. Fruit and veg awaits its final fate; coming under the scrutiny of inspectors.

They may pick out a few flaws that developed during shipping, or that the farmers missed on the field. This could mean that they summarily reject the whole shipment.

Some of that rejected fruit goes on to feed cattle, but none feeds a single hungry human. A shocking waste that should be criminal.

Not even the blessing of the packhouse inspector will necessarily prevent food wastage. The produce still has to go through the dangers of long-distance food transportation all over again. This time on its final journey – the trip to the supermarket.

<h2>5. THROWN OUT OF THE SUPERMARKET</h2>
Perhaps you’ve heard the sales adage ‘pile it high, sell it cheap’. This saying was coined in the 1950s by Sir Jack Cohen, founder of Tesco.

It sums up the modus operandi of all the supermarkets that spawned in the following decades. You’ve seen that philosophy in action if you’ve ever tried to dig through a mountain of apples at the supermarket.

Supermarkets believe that customers prefer to see full shelves and big piles of produce. They routinely order more than they can sell — all to complete an image of first-world bounty.

Naturally, a large proportion of this food becomes overripe. Some supermarkets, independent shops or small chains move the ripe fruits to a bargain bin. Shoppers who aren’t afraid of a few spots can pick up great deals.

The majority of the big chains can’t be bothered to spare the labour required to repackage squishy fruit. The overripe supermarket produce, once a member of the elite upper echelon, then joins its rejected brethren in landfill.
